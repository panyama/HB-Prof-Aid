# panYama - Public Custom Profiles
This repository is used as a library for all my personal public profiles. These profiles are developed for Honorbuddy.


## Description
These profiles are based on years of experience in World of Warcraft and mind to environment and character classes.
The profiles that you may find here are might be of the following type:

* Leveling
* Dailies
* Gathering
* Fishing
* Reputation
* Other

The profiles are developed with an eye for perfection, and thus leaving out as many bugs. If there are any bugs do not AFK the profile unless it's do-able by your class and environment, but this is at your own risk. I'm not responsible for the mistakes or bans that may occure to your account. Always bot with cauntions.


## Updates
If you want the latest model of the profile that you're using then we recommend CheckingOut often with your SVN client.If I haven't updated your profile to the current patch/content/changes, notify me through the forum so I can put it on my to-do list.
 
## Profiles (Free)
These profiles you find here are free of use, and can be modified by you as user to accommodate your needs. But the support it little to none if you modified my profile.

Since these are free profiles, support towards them has less priority then those that are paid for. My paid profiles can be found at the BuddyStore. By buying my profiles you do not support my beer, coffee, or sandwhiches but rather my medical bill, I thank you for doing so.

## Reporting Bugs
When reporting a bug please include your full log file (found in the "Logs" directory), then explain in full detail what the bug consists of, if possible a screenshot that could visually support your problem is useful in tracking down the bug.
