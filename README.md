# panYama - Custom Tailored Profiles
We use this library on Github for profiles developed for Honorbuddy and it's features.

## Description
Welcome to panYama's custome tailored profiles.
These profiles are based on eigth years of experiences throughout World of Warcraft and a full understanding of it's environment and features.
We are always up-to-date with the current build and upcoming builds in World of Warcraft that can make or break the profiles.
If we develop our profiles we do take the time to narrow down bugs and make it as perfect as possible in order to keep your account safe and to make sure you enjoy watching the bot do his work.

## Updates
If you are interested in using our custom tailor profiles we suggest checking in regularly for updates.
 
## Developing Profiles (Free)
We develop profiles for many features within Honorbuddy, if by any chance a third party plugin/botbase is not listed does not mean we won't develop for it.

    Supported Botbases:
	
* BGBuddy
* Questing
* Grind Bot
* Gatherbuddy
* Grindbuddy
* Professionbuddy
* AutoAngler

If new features are developed and we are interested in making profiles, they will be added.

## Developing Profiles (Paid)
Besides public profiles we also offer a range of paid profiles, these contain a better security since it's not the majority that uses the profiles.
These profiles are better for the safety of your accounts, and are tested throughly with multiple accounts to ensure to be AFK free.
